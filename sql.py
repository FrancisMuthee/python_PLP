Section A: Definitions

1.    
Define the following key terms related to databases:

1.1.1.     Database; This is collection of organized data stored in tabular form.

1.1.2.     Table; This is a combination of rows and columns to store data

1.1.3.     Record; A record is a given piece of row that consists of data of a particular ID.

1.1.4.     Field; This is a particular column that holds data of a similar characteristics in a given database. They are organized into columns.

1.1.5.     Primary Key; This ia a unique identifier of each row or column in a database.

1.1.6.     SQL; This is a domain-specific language used for manipulating data in a database to get the necessary information required from relational databases.

1.1.7.     Query; This is a instruction to get a response from the data. They are written in a database query language.

1.1.8.     Index; This is a structured way used to retrieve data easily by using specific index, hence improving data retrieval operations.

1.1.9.     Normalization; This is a process whereby data is stored in tables and columns reducing anomalies. The tables are reduced into smaller sizeshence making it easy to retrieve data.

1.1.10.  Database Management System (DBMS)
2.  Section B: Discussions
1.1.1.     Describe the purpose of a primary key in a database table and provide an example.

The main purpose of a primary key is to uniquely identify a particular entity in a given set. In a registration list of clients, you can have clientID as a primary key to ensure that clients do not share the same Id.
1.1.2.     Explain the difference between a database management system (DBMS) and a database.

DBMS is software for interacting with databases while a database is a collection of organized data in tabular form.
1.1.3.     Discuss in short, the importance of normalization in database design and provide an example of how it can improve data integrity.

Normalization helps in organizing data in well structured form reducing anomalies. It improves data integrity by reducing the tables into smaller sizes hence making it easy to make changes.
